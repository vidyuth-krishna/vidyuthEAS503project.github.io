## Code Summary

This project involves:
- **Training and Pipelining models** using various algorithms (Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Random Forest, XGBoost) and logging the results in Dagshub on MLFlow.
- **Feature Engineering and Feature Selection** - PCA, Correlation Threshold, Feature Importance, and Variance Threshold.
- **Containerizing the application** with Docker container.
- **Deploying to AWS** using ECS.
- **Creating an interactive Streamlit app** for real-time predictions.
